    <strong>Global Connection
    </strong>
    <span>Fostering healthy relationships between older adults and youth is extremely impactful. Although we are starting in NYC, we hope that we can expand our impact and make sure youth worldwide have an understanding and appreciation for the older adult community, and vice versa!</span>

    <strong>Social Support
    </strong>
    <span>There are many issues that surround the older adult community such as negligence and elder abuse, and through exposing the youth to these issues, we hope that we can foster an understanding youth community that has passion to solve these issues, and also volunteer for GEM&apos;s events.</span>

          <div class="card">
    <strong>Development
    </strong>
    <span>While GEM&apos;s main ideal is to benefit the older adult community, the youth can benefit tremendously through volunteering with us. Volunteering and cultivating kindness is a crucial trait for success in the world, and GEM can contribute to developing these skills at a young age.
